Your script appears to be well-structured for processing IoT data, particularly for handling noisy temperature and pressure readings. It includes mechanisms for outlier detection, median filtering, and publishing the processed data. Let's analyze the key components related to noise handling:

Outlier Detection using Z-score
You calculate Z-scores for temperature and pressure data to detect outliers. This is an effective statistical method for identifying data points that are significantly different from the rest of the dataset.
The use of a threshold of 3 for the Z-score is standard for outlier detection. It identifies values that are more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean, which are likely to be outliers.
Handling Outliers
Once an outlier is detected, you replace it with the median of the last 10 readings. This is a reasonable approach to mitigate the impact of extreme values while maintaining the general trend and variability of the data.
Alternative strategies like skipping outliers or replacing them with the last valid value are commented out but provide good options depending on your specific requirements.
Data Processing Threads
Separate threads for processing temperature and pressure data help in parallel processing and improve the efficiency of the system.
The median filter applied to the last 10 data points in each thread is a robust method to smooth out the data, reducing the impact of any remaining noise or minor fluctuations.
Data Publishing
The processed data, along with the site information and a timestamp, is combined and published to an MQTT topic. This is a key step for making the processed data available for further analysis or monitoring.
Including a timestamp in the published data is crucial for time-series analysis and for tracking the performance and conditions over time.
General Structure and Robustness
The script is structured to continuously process incoming data and can be gracefully shut down with a keyboard interrupt.
Exception handling in the extract_and_store_data function adds robustness, ensuring that parsing errors in the incoming messages don't crash the script.
Considerations for Improvement
Data Window Size: The window size of 10 for both the Z-score calculation and median filtering is a critical parameter. You may need to adjust this size based on the frequency of data collection and the expected variability in your temperature and pressure readings.
Data Preprocessing Validation: It's essential to validate the preprocessing steps, especially the outlier handling part, to ensure that it aligns with the actual characteristics of your data and doesn't introduce bias.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Before finalizing the preprocessing steps, conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a subset of your data can be very beneficial. It helps in understanding the distribution and characteristics of the data, which can inform the fine-tuning of your preprocessing parameters.
Overall, your script incorporates critical steps for noise reduction and data preprocessing, making it well-suited for handling and analyzing noisy temperature and pressure data from IoT devices.
